    <p>This website is for those who are using Netflix, and want to try watching Korean movies or dramas.</p>
    <p>As Korean, I feel very proud of the quality of video industry of our country. There are many works that fully represent local culture of Korea,
      and also a number of masterpieces in terms of artistry and skills. I made my own list of recommendation on this website.</p>
    <p>With brief introduction to each work, I added some information that would be useful for you to understand the story.
      I believe that this website can be a wonderful place for those who want to be closer to Korea, and also to those who want to entertain themselves with Korean dramas and movies.</p>
    <p>Netflix is a great platform, but there still are many great works that are not uploaded on Netflix.
      I suggetst that Netflix keep up its good work to introduce more Korean works worldwide.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my website. Have a good time!</p>
